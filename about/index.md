<a href="http://hubert0527.github.io/">Hubert</a> receives his bachelor in NTHU and now working with Prof. <a href="http://aliensunmin.github.io/">Min Sun</a> as a research assistant. 

Hubert's research interest is mainly in generative models and neural architecture search. He believes that the generative model is a very important way to visualize and empirical proof that the machine intelligence can fully understand the data and the implicit meanings behind the scene. In the meanwhile, neural architecture search is the key-stone to fully-automated model design, which will be the next break-through in deep learning. What will happen after machines can iteratively self-optimize with any given dataset? Hubert hopes he can become a CLO (Chief Labelling Officer) or CPO (Chief Preprocessing Officer) after that. 

Hubert is also looking for a Ph.D. position in 2020.
